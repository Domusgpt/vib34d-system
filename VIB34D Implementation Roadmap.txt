VIB34D Implementation Roadmap
This document outlines the phased development plan for building the VIB34D system as specified in the VIB34D Unified System Codex.
Phase 1: Foundational Core & Configuration
Objective: Establish the bedrock of the application. The goal is to create a system that can load all configurations from the JSON files and render a static, non-interactive layout based on that data.
Task ID
	Task
	Description
	Key Modules
	Dependencies
	1.1
	Implement JsonConfigSystem
	Create the module responsible for fetching, parsing, and validating the four core JSON files (layout-content, visuals, behavior, state-map). It should provide a simple API to access this configuration data.
	JsonConfigSystem
	None
	1.2
	Implement SystemController
	Create the main application orchestrator. On boot, it should initialize the JsonConfigSystem and load all configurations into memory.
	SystemController
	Task 1.1
	1.3
	Implement Static Layout Engine
	The SystemController will read the layout-content.json and dynamically generate the DOM elements (e.g., create divs for each card and component). At this stage, these are just empty placeholders.
	SystemController
	Task 1.2
	1.4
	Basic Theming
	Apply the default theme from visuals.json to the main application container using basic CSS variables for colors and fonts to confirm the visual configuration is being read.
	SystemController
	Task 1.3
	Success Metric: The application loads and displays the basic card and component layout described in layout-content.json without any errors. No interactivity or WebGL rendering yet.
Phase 2: Visualizer Rendering & Geometry
Objective: Breathe life into the static layout by rendering the initial WebGL visualizers. This phase focuses on getting the WebGL pipeline working and displaying the default geometry.
Task ID
	Task
	Description
	Key Modules
	Dependencies
	2.1
	Implement GeometryRegistry
	Create a module that loads the geometry definitions from visuals.json, mapping geometry names to their respective GLSL shader file paths.
	GeometryRegistry
	Phase 1
	2.2
	Implement VisualizerPool
	This module will manage the lifecycle of WebGL contexts. Its initial version will be responsible for creating a <canvas> element for each AdaptiveCard and initializing a WebGL context.
	VisualizerPool
	Phase 1
	2.3
	Create Initial GLSL Shaders
	Develop simple vertex and fragment shaders for one geometry (e.g., hypercube.glsl). The shaders should accept basic uniforms like u_time and u_gridDensity.
	N/A (Assets)
	None
	2.4
	Connect Controller to Pool
	The SystemController will instruct the VisualizerPool to attach a visualizer instance to each card rendered in Phase 1. It will pass the default parameter values from visuals.json as uniforms.
	SystemController, VisualizerPool
	Task 2.2, 2.3
	Success Metric: Each card in the layout now contains a running WebGL visualizer displaying the default geometry, animating based on u_time.
Phase 3: State Management & Navigation
Objective: Make the application interactive by implementing state changes and navigation between the "pages" or "tesseract faces" defined in state-map.json.
Task ID
	Task
	Description
	Key Modules
	Dependencies
	3.1
	Implement HomeMaster
	This module will act as the single source of truth for the application's current state (e.g., activeState: 'home').
	HomeMaster
	Phase 1
	3.2
	Integrate state-map.json
	The SystemController will use state-map.json to set the initial state in the HomeMaster and to understand the available states.
	SystemController, HomeMaster
	Task 3.1
	3.3
	Implement Basic Navigation
	The InteractionCoordinator will be created to handle basic keyboard input as defined in state-map.json's navigation block. It will emit events like navigateTo
	InteractionCoordinator
	Phase 1
	3.4
	Implement State Transitions
	The SystemController will listen for navigateTo events, update the HomeMaster, and re-render the view to reflect the new state (e.g., show/hide cards, change themes, switch active visualizer geometries).
	SystemController
	Task 3.2, 3.3
	Success Metric: The user can navigate between different application states using the keyboard, and the content/visuals update accordingly.
Phase 4: Relational Interaction Physics
Objective: Implement the sophisticated, ecosystem-wide interaction model. This is the most complex phase and brings the UI to life.
Task ID
	Task
	Description
	Key Modules
	Dependencies
	4.1
	Parse interactionBlueprints
	The InteractionCoordinator must be enhanced to fully parse and understand the complex interactionBlueprints object from behavior.json.
	InteractionCoordinator
	Phase 3
	4.2
	Implement Relational Targeting
	Implement the logic to resolve subject, parent, ecosystem, etc., relative to the element that triggered an event.
	InteractionCoordinator
	Task 4.1
	4.3
	Implement Animation Engine
	Create the core animation logic within the InteractionCoordinator. It will translate the physics properties (to, curve, duration) into smooth parameter transitions over time.
	InteractionCoordinator
	Task 4.2
	4.4
	Full Interaction Integration
	Attach the full suite of event listeners (onHover, onClick, etc.). When an event fires, the InteractionCoordinator will execute the full reaction described in the blueprint, updating parameters across all targeted elements.
	InteractionCoordinator
	Task 4.3
	Success Metric: All interactions defined in behavior.json work as specified. Hovering a button causes the button, its parent card, and all other cards to react with nuanced, coordinated animations.
Phase 5: Agent API & Finalization
Objective: Expose system controls to the outside world for agent-based manipulation and complete the final features.
Task ID
	Task
	Description
	Key Modules
	Dependencies
	5.1
	Implement the agentAPI
	Create the global window.agentAPI object. Wire up its methods (navigateTo, setMasterParameter, etc.) to the appropriate SystemController and HomeMaster functions.
	agentAPI
	Phase 4
	5.2
	Implement Config Hot-Reloading
	The agentAPI.updateConfig() method should trigger the JsonConfigSystem to re-fetch a specific config file and then instruct the SystemController to perform a "hot restart" to apply the changes without a full page reload.
	agentAPI, JsonConfigSystem, SystemController
	Task 5.1
	5.3
	Performance & Bug Squashing
	Conduct thorough testing across the entire application. Profile rendering performance and optimize any bottlenecks in the animation engine or WebGL shaders.
	All
	All
	5.4
	Final Documentation Review
	Update all documentation to reflect the final implementation and API.
	N/A (Docs)
	All
	Success Metric: The VIB34D system is fully functional, controllable via the agentAPI, and performs smoothly.
